Get done after test:
- global autosave queue
- game time / day time tick comparison (== is now invalid due to desync of global / region tick)
- scoreboards
- vanish api
- watchdog stuff
- Spectator teleporting / camera
- Conversable...
- sync load info
- net.minecraft.commands.Commands 
- are the race conditions in the weather tick (advanceWeatherCycle) ok?
- make scheduler load chunks better? this requires additional work to:
  -> reduce scheduler overhead (i.e at 5000 regions, on 16 threads -> overhead is 10%)
    -> unsure how to reduce scheduler overhead, may need to rewrite it so that the queues 
       are per tick thread and thus it increases parallelism
  -> reduce chunk system overhead (i.e at 20 workers, ~100 unique concurrent regions, overhead -> 10-30% on both workers AND tick threads (at tick threads ->8)
    -> the only way out of the chunk system overhead is to make the scheduling more parallel - it requires scheduling lock and ticket lock
- redstone wire across regions

Delayed and hopefully will not forget:
- api for really a lot of shit
  - needs: true async events (i.e fire then complete later)
  - needs: region determination, craft scheduler per region, craft scheduler
           per entity
  - needs: world creation/unload (good god)
  - needs: more???
- Projectile#getOwner ...
